"Dealing with brains as multi-level systems is essential if we are to make even the slightest progress in analyzing elusive mental phenomena such as perception, concepts, thinking, consciousness, »I«, free will, and so forth." (30)

"our brains [...] contain tiny events (neuron firings) and larger events (patterns of neuron frings), and the latter presumably somehow have <i>representational</i> qualities, allowing us to register and also to remember things that happen outside of our crania. Such internalization of the outer world in symbolic patterns in a brain is a pretty far-fetched idea, when you think about it, and yet we know it somehow came to exist, thanks to the pressures of evolution." (46)

"I begin with the simple fact that living beings, having been shaped by evolution, have survival as their most fundamental, automatic, and built-in goal. To enhance the chances of its survival, any living being must be able to react flexibly to events that take place in its environment. This means it must develop the ability to sense and to categorize, however rudimentarily, the goings-on in its immediate environment (most earthbound beings can pretty safely ignore comets crashing on Jupiter). Once the ability to sense external goings-on has developed, however, there ensues a curious side effect that will have vital and radical consequences. This is the fact that the living being's ability to sense certain aspects of its environment flips around and endows the being with the ability to sense certain aspects of <i>itself</i>. (73)

"Indeed, thinking about how one might tackle such an engineering challenge is a helpful way of simultaneously envisioning the process of perception in the brain of a living creature and its counterpart in the cognitive system of an artificial mind (or an alien creature, for that matter)." (77)

"A creature that thinks knows next to nothing of the subtrate allowing its thinking to happen, but nonetheless it knows all about its symbolic interpretation of the world, and knows very intimately something it calls »I«." (173)

"a human brain is a representational system that knows no bounds in terms of extensibility or flexibility of its categories." (182)

"The closing of the strange loop of human selfhood is deeply dependent upon the level-changing leap that is <i>perception</i>, which means <i>categorization</i>, and therefore, the richer and more powerful an organism's categorization equipment is, the more realized and rich will be its self." (209)

"Through language, other people's bodies can become flexible extensions of our own bodies." (213)

"A novel is not a specific sequence of words, because if it were, it could only be written in <i>one</i> language, in <i>one</i> culture. No, a novel is a <i>pattern</i> -- a particular collection of characters, events, moods, tones, jokes, allusions, and much more. And so a novel is an abstraction [...]." (224)

"The cells inside a brain are not the bearers of its consciousness; the bearers of consciousness are <i>patterns</i>. The pattern of organization is what matters, not the substance." (257)

"...symbol-level brain activity [...] that mirrors external events <i>is</i> consciousness" (276)

"My brain [...] is constantly seeking to label, to categorize, to find precedents and analogues – in other words, <i>to simplify while not letting essence slip away</i>." (279)

"[...] category assignments go right to the core of thinking, they are determinant of our attitude toward each thing in the world [...]." (319)

"we human beings [...] are unpredictable self-writing poems -- vague, metaphorical, ambiguous, and sometimes exceedingly beautiful." (363)
